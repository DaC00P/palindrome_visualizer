##### A palindrome is a word that contains the same characters when read forwards and backwards.
##### This application will allow the user to enter a paragraph of text and see visually which words in the paragraph are palindromes
##### The user should be able to actively type, and the app will check each word typed in a live-action fashion.
##### The checking of palindromes should only happen when a word has finished being typed - don't go crazy with the computations.
